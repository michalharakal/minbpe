Byte pair encoding (BPE) is a simple form of data compression in which the most common pair of consecutive bytes of data is replaced with a byte that does not occur within that data. A table of the replacements is required to rebuild the original data. The algorithm was first described publicly by Philip Gage in a February 1994 article "A New Algorithm for Data Compression" in the C Users Journal.

BPE is particularly effective for natural language processing tasks where it helps to handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into subword units. This approach has been widely adopted in modern language models and tokenization systems.
